## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Create React App sets up a modern build toolchain and development server so that you can focus on writing React code.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── logo.svg
└── .gitignore
```

The `node_modules` directory contains all of the dependencies of the project. The `package.json` file contains the project's metadata, such as the name, version, and dependencies. The `README.md` file contains the documentation for the project. The `src` directory contains the source code for the project. The `App.css` file contains the styles for the project. The `App.js` file contains the main component for the project. The `App.test.js` file contains the tests for the project. The `index.css` file contains the styles for the index page. The `index.js` file contains the main code for the index page. The `logo.svg` file contains the logo for the project. The `.gitignore` file contains the files that should be ignored by Git.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/
